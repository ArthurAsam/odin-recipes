        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>This is a great recipe for an autumn day. It is basically fall in a bowl. With only 5 ingredients, you can definitely make a meal with the produce you have leftover in the fridge. This recipe requires butter, (onions, celery, carrots, potatoes), butternut-squash, chicken stock and salt & pepper. It is important to cut, skin and scoop the seeds from the squash. A great way to remove the skin is with a vegetable peeler. Pairing this recipe with some corn muffins or croutons adds another layer of texture and is really yummy. Enjoy!</p>
