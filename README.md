# odin-recipes
This is my first repo containing project files for a recipe website. This project will demonstrate a basic understanding of web development workflow in its entirety. Showing knowledge of how to create a repo, clone, fetch, pull, commit, push and write sound commit messages for collaboration. This project also demonstrates knowledge of HTML and CSS.
